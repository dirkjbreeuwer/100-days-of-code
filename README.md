## Daily Log

- Day 1: Created this README.md, fixed a bug in [To-do App in React](https://github.com/dirkjbreeuwer/todoapp-react). Project is getting messy, need to do a significant refactor. Struggling to implement edit functionality. #Todo: Implement edit functionality in isolation of current project (i.e. break down the problem).
- Day 2: Started adding the "edit" functionality in the [To-do App in React](https://github.com/dirkjbreeuwer/todoapp-react). It now allows to edit, missing styling and delete functionality.
- Day 3 & 4: Had a large deliverable at work and had to priorize health.
- Day 5: Productive day: Added edit functionality to [To-do App in React](https://github.com/dirkjbreeuwer/todoapp-react). Created new repo with [OSSU Core Curriculum notes and assignments](https://github.com/dirkjbreeuwer/ossu-cs-curriculum).
- Day 6: Limited work, took saturday off.
- Day 7: Dedicated 6 or 7 hours today. Great progress with OSSU core curriculum. Reworked many of the [HTC excercises](https://github.com/dirkjbreeuwer/ossu-cs-curriculum/blob/main/core-programming/how-to-code-simple-data/README.md), feel a much more solid understanding on self-reference. Strong understanding of data definitions and how they influence function definitions. Strong understanding of helpers.
- Day 8: Worked on two "difficult" [HtC excercises](https://github.com/dirkjbreeuwer/ossu-cs-curriculum/blob/main/core-programming/how-to-code-simple-data/README.md) today, great progress. Working on the "spinning bears" assignment.
- Day 9: Continued working on the "spinning bears" assignment.
